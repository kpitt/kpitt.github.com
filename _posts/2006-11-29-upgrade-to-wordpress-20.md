I finally upgraded the blog to run on WordPress 2.0. I've been holding off on this for awhile because I just haven't had the time to deal with it. I'm happy to report, though, that the upgrade went just as smoothly as the WordPress documentation claims.

After backing up the database and files from the previous blog installation, I downloaded the ZIP file for WordPress 2.0.5, extracted the files to my local disk, and uploaded them to my host server with FileZilla. I then entered the URL of the upgrade script into the browser, clicked the Upgrade link, and voila!

Now why can't all software upgrades go this smoothly?
