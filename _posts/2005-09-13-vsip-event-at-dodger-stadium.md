The company I work for, [SPI Dynamics](http://www.spidynamics.com/), is a Microsoft VSIP partner. The Visual Studio Integration team from Microsoft held a special partner-only tailgate party last night at Dodger Stadium with tickets to the Los Angeles Dodgers vs. Colorado Rockies game. I'm not a sports fanatic, and being from Atlanta I'm definately not a Dodgers fan (Go Braves!), but sitting in the second row of the field level just inside the right field foul pole was a pretty cool experience even for a geek.
