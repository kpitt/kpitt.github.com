It looks like this blog was recently hacked with a rather nasty, malware-distributing trojan, and apparently this has been a rather wide-spread problem. Hopefully there weren't too many visitors turned away by the "Warning - visiting this web site may harm your computer!" message from Google. Here is a blog article with [more information](http://www.tipstrickstoolstechniques.com/?p=113) about the problem. I deleted all of the WordPress files and upgraded to WordPress 2.5.1, then reloaded all of the ScribbishWP theme files from a backup. Finally, I had to hand-clean my WordPress config files and a few static HTML files. I asked for a Google review of the site after the cleanup and it looks like we're in the clear for now, but please [email me](mailto:kenny.pitt@gmail.com) if you notice anything like this happening again!
