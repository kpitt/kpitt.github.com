From [eWeek](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2000205,00.asp), the free development tools market is about to get bigger as Borland resurrects the Turbo brand. In addition to Turbo C++, the lineup includes Turbo Delphi for Win32, Turbo Delphi for .NET, and Turbo C#. Each Turbo product will be available in a free Explorer version and a more advanced Professional version. More details are available at [www.turboexplorer.com](http://www.turboexplorer.com/).
