[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.com/) is a hot topic in the Web development community right now.  I've always enjoyed learning interesting new languages and environments because I think it makes you a better programmer even if you never use them in a production application.  Apple Developer Connection recently posted an article by [Mike Clark](http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom) entitled [Using Ruby on Rails for Web Development on Mac OS X](http://developer.apple.com/tools/rubyonrails.html).  I followed the instructions referenced in the article and had no problem getting the latest versions of Ruby, Rails, and MySQL running on the Mac Mini.  The next step will be to follow along with the examples and try to create a simple Rails app of my own.  At first glance, Rails has a lot of intriguing features and I'm looking forward to learning more.
