How did I manage to miss this for so long?  TextMate, the Mac text editor
that set the standard by which all modern programmer's editors are judged,
is [now Open Source][tm_gpl_blog].  TextMate 2.0 is still in alpha status,
but the first alpha build was released over 21 months ago, so it's probably
pretty stable by now.

You can [download the binary][tm_download], or access the [source on GitHub][tm_github].
The latest builds require at least OS X 10.7, so those of you still running
on older versions are out of luck.  On the bright side, it costs less for an
OS X upgrade than it used to cost for a TextMate license.
