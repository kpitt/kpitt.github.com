Via [Ajaxian](http://ajaxian.com/archives/announcing-ajax-libraries-api-speed-up-your-ajax-apps-with-googles-infrastructure): Google is now hosting a number of open-source AJAX libraries, so you can take advantage of the vast Google infrastructure to reduce the load on your server. Complete details on how to access the script files can be found in the [AJAX Libraries API Developer's Guide](http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlibs/documentation/).
