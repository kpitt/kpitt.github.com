Philipp Lenssen posted some [tips for Google Talk](http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2005-08-25-n18.html). Be sure to read the comments, too, for additional tips discovered by readers.

My favorite tip is adding emphasis in messages using the ***bold*** and __italic__ convention that has been commonly used in plain-text e-mail and Usenet posts for years. I've never been one to use a lot of formatting in IM's, so this is perfect for me. Simple, clean, gets the job done.
