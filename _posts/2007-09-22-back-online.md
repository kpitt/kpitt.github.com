We're finally back after some extended downtime. Obviously I don't get around to updating the site very often, so I'm sure it comes as no surprise that I didn't notice the problem right away. A big thanks to [Jeffrey](http://quotedprintable.com/) who emailed to inform me that ScribbishWP was unavailable. All of the static content on the site was accessible, but all of the WordPress-powered pages were down. It took technical support a week to track down and fix the problem, but as of last night everything seems to be working again.

So if you've been having trouble accessing [ScribbishWP](http://pittcrew.net/geekblog/scribbishwp/), give it another try now. And stay tuned for a long-overdue update in the near future (I'm putting that in writing in the hopes that it will motivate me to finally wrap this up).
