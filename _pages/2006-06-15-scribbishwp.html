<a href="http://quotedprintable.com/">Packagethief</a> (aka Jeffrey Allan Hardy) has created an awesome theme for <a href="http://typosphere.org/">Typo</a> called <a href="http://quotedprintable.com/pages/scribbish">Scribbish</a>. As a WordPress user, I was extremely jealous because I have been unable to find a theme that comes anywhere close to the same simplicity and elegance. So with Jeff's permission, I created a WordPress version of the Scribbish theme which I've dubbed ScribbishWP.

ScribbishWP attempts to format posts according to the <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom">hAtom microformat specification</a>. I've validated the output on the PittGeek blog using <a href="http://lukearno.com/projects/hatom2atom/">hatom2atom</a> and it currently parses correctly. Note that all of your post content must be valid XHTML to produce hAtom-compliant output.

ScribbishWP has only been tested on WordPress 2.2. Your mileage may vary on other versions. I've also only tested it with the blog options that I use so there may be some areas that will not display properly with other options. In particular, the popup comment entry window has not been themed yet.

There are several style variations available in ScribbishWP:

<ul>
    <li>Original-width or wide-width layout</li>
    <li>Scribbish 2.0 or Scribbish 3.0 header styles</li>
    <li>Right or left sidebar position</li>
</ul>

The defaults are original-width layout, right sidebar, and Scribbish 2.0 header styles because that is what I use on this blog. You can change the defaults by editing the <code>style.css</code> file. Just look for the commented sections.
