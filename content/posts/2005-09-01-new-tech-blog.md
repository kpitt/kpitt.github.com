My name is Kenny Pitt. Very few people have ever heard of me, and I don't expect that to change just because I started a blog. I'll probably lose interest in this after a month or two and stop posting, but who knows?

I created this blog for all the geeky, technical stuff that nobody over on my [family blog](/news) is going to want to read. It's a place for me to capture links to cool applications, useful technical info, occasional thoughts about programming, and maybe even a code snippet or two. If anyone but me finds this interesting or useful, I'll be amazed, but please let me know if you do.
