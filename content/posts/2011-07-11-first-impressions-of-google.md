At first glance, Google+ seems promising. I like how the Circles feature gives you more control over who you share with. The desktop browser interface looks nice and works well, but the mobile experience on the iPhone leaves something to be desired. Several features are unavailable including photo uploading and profile editing, and viewing someone else's profile still redirects to Google Buzz. The iPad just displays a larger version of the iPhone interface that doesn't take any advantage of the increased screen size. I hope Google will do a better job with iPad support than Facebook has. I'm looking forward to seeing what they've done with the iOS app, which is supposedly just waiting for approval from Apple.
