Clearly blog posts have been very sparse here, so I'm going to try something new. Whenever I find a good article or web site that helps me solve a particular problem I'm having, I'll try to dash off a quick post referencing it. This'll help me locate the information if I need it again later, and maybe it will help someone else find what they're looking for too.

I recently needed to return a JavaScript resource from a custom ASP.NET control and wondered if I could take advantage of "WebResource.axd" myself. Via ASP.NET blogger Jeff Putz, [_Using WebResource.axd for embedded resources_](http://weblogs.asp.net/jeff/archive/2005/07/18/419842.aspx) shows you how.
