I'm a little behind the times in blogging about this, but I needed to actually have a blog first. Rumors have been flying for a while that Google was planning to release its own IM service, and now [Google Talk](http://talk.google.com/) is here. It is based on the [Jabber](http://www.jabber.org/) [XMPP](http://www.xmpp.org/) protocol, but it isn't yet linked into the Jabber server network.

You won't find any fancy features in the minimalist client program, but that can sometimes be a good thing as it seems to use far fewer system resources than most other clients. If you want a more feature-rich client, you should be able to connect with any client that supports Jabber. You'll also need to use a different client if you are not running on Windows, because the Google Talk client is currently a Windows-only application.

Currently, you can only chat with other Google Talk users, although Google [promises that they are committed to interoperability](http://www.google.com/talk/about.html#open). Unfortunately, I don't know of any friends that are on Google Talk yet, so I can't give it a thorough test in daily use.
