title: Internet Explorer Inside a Firefox Tab

Via [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=4d139743-1b0f-422c-943f-7d13db1472bb), you can now display a web page with Internet Explorer directly inside a Firefox tab. The extension is called [IE Tab](http://ietab.mozdev.org/), and it provides similar functionality to the older [IE View](http://ieview.mozdev.org/) except that it embeds Internet Explorer inside Firefox instead of opening a separate IE window. Once installed, you can right-click a page in Firefox and switch to IE mode without switching tabs. You can also right-click a link and open the link in a new IE tab. You can even configure a list of sites that will always display in an IE tab!

It's not perfect yet, but 99% of the time it does a fantastic job. [Netscape 8.0](http://browser.netscape.com/ns8/) has a similar feature, but I find it a bit cumbersome and I really like being able to do it directly in Firefox.
